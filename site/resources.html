      <h2>Traditional Carmelite Prayers</h2>
      <h3>Prayer of St. Teresa of Ávila</h3>
      <blockquote>
        Let nothing disturb you,<br>
        Let nothing frighten you,<br>
        All things are passing away:<br>
        God never changes.<br>
        Patience obtains all things.<br>
        Whoever has God lacks nothing;<br>
        God alone suffices.
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Prayer of St. John of the Cross</h3>
      <blockquote>
        O Lord my God, my Beloved!<br>
        If still You remember my sins in such a way that You do not do what I beg of You, may Your will be done concerning them, which is what I most desire, and exercise Your goodness and mercy, and You will be known through them. And if it is that You are waiting for my good works so as to hear my prayer through their means, grant them to me, and work them for me, and the sufferings You desire to accept, and let it be done. But if You are not waiting for my works, what is it that makes You wait, my most clement Lord?
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Prayer of St. Thérèse of Lisieux (Act of Oblation to Merciful Love)</h3>
      <blockquote>
        O my God! Most Blessed Trinity, I desire to Love You and make You Loved, to work for the glory of Holy Church by saving souls on earth and liberating those suffering in purgatory. I desire to accomplish Your will perfectly and to reach the degree of glory You have prepared for me in Your Kingdom. I desire, in a word, to be a saint...
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Prayer of St. Elizabeth of the Trinity</h3>
      <blockquote>
        O my God, Trinity whom I adore, help me forget myself entirely so to establish myself in You, unmovable and peaceful as if my soul were already in eternity. May nothing be able to trouble my peace or make me leave You, O my unchanging God, but may each minute bring me more deeply into Your mystery. Grant my soul peace. Make it Your heaven, Your beloved dwelling and the place of Your rest. May I never abandon You there, but may I be there, whole and entire, completely vigilant in my faith, entirely adoring, and wholly given up to Your creative action.
      </blockquote>
