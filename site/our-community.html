      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>The Coastal Community of St. John of the Cross is a lay Carmelite community affiliated with the Secular Order of Discalced Carmelites (OCDS). We are men and women from diverse backgrounds and vocations—married and single, young and old, working professionals and retirees—united by a common call to contemplative prayer and the Carmelite way of life.</p>
      <p>We live "in the world" but seek to cultivate interior silence, detachment, and union with God in the midst of our daily responsibilities. Our community provides formation, spiritual support, and fraternal fellowship as we journey together toward deeper intimacy with Christ.</p>

      <h2>Our Carmelite Heritage</h2>
      <p>The Carmelite Order traces its origins to Mount Carmel in the Holy Land during the 12th century, where hermits gathered to live lives of prayer, silence, and devotion to God. Inspired by the prophet Elijah and guided by the patronage of Our Lady, these early hermits sought to "live in allegiance to Jesus Christ" through contemplative prayer.</p>
      <p>In the 16th century, St. Teresa of Ávila and St. John of the Cross reformed the Order, emphasizing radical poverty, interior prayer, and mystical union with God. This reform—the Discalced Carmelites—gave birth to a profound spiritual tradition that continues to guide souls today.</p>
      <p>The Third Order, now known as the Secular Order of Discalced Carmelites (OCDS), allows lay people to participate in this rich tradition while living their vocations in the world.</p>

      <h2>The Carmelite Rule of Life</h2>
      <h3>Daily Prayer</h3>
      <p>Members commit to at least 30 minutes of mental prayer each day, seeking to cultivate an interior life of silence and contemplation. We also pray portions of the Liturgy of the Hours and dedicate time to spiritual reading.</p>
      <h3>Simple Living</h3>
      <p>Following the spirit of poverty and detachment, we seek to live simply, valuing what is essential and letting go of excessive attachment to material goods, comfort, and worldly pursuits.</p>
      <h3>Fraternal Charity</h3>
      <p>We support one another in prayer and friendship, building a community that reflects Christ's love. This includes regular attendance at monthly meetings and maintaining bonds of fraternal charity.</p>
      <h3>Service to the Church</h3>
      <p>Carmelites are called to serve the Church through prayer, witness, and charitable works. We offer our lives as a hidden sacrifice of prayer for priests, missionaries, and the needs of the world.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Leadership &amp; Spiritual Direction</h2>
      <p>Our community is guided by a Council composed of elected members and a spiritual assistant (usually a Discalced Carmelite friar or priest). The Council provides leadership, coordinates formation, and ensures the community remains faithful to the Carmelite charism.</p>
      <p>Each member is encouraged to have a regular spiritual director who can guide them in their personal journey of prayer and growth in holiness.</p>
