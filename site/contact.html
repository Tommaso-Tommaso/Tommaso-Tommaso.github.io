      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>Do I need to be Catholic to attend?</h3>
      <p>Yes, membership in the Secular Order of Discalced Carmelites requires being a practicing Catholic in good standing with the Church. However, those who are exploring the Catholic faith or in RCIA are welcome to attend meetings as guests.</p>
      <h3>Is there a cost to join?</h3>
      <p>There are no membership dues, but members are encouraged to support the community through voluntary contributions to cover costs of materials, meeting space, and occasional events. Financial concerns should never prevent anyone from joining.</p>
      <h3>Can I attend if I'm married with a family?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely! The OCDS is specifically for lay people living in the world. Many of our members are married, have children, work full-time, or have other commitments. The Carmelite vocation is about bringing contemplative prayer into everyday life.</p>
      <h3>What if I can't attend every monthly meeting?</h3>
      <p>We understand that life circumstances sometimes prevent attendance. While regular participation is important for formation and community life, we work with each member's situation. Speak with the formation director about your particular needs.</p>
      <h3>Do I need to have experience with contemplative prayer?</h3>
      <p>Not at all! Many people come to us precisely because they want to learn about contemplative prayer and the interior life. Formation provides guidance and teaching on mental prayer, Lectio Divina, and growing in union with God.</p>
