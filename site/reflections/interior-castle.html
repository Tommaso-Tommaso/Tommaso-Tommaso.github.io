      <div class="article-content">
        <p class="intro">The Interior Castle is St. Teresa of Avila's most mature and luminous work — a masterpiece of mystical theology and a roadmap for the soul's transformation in God. Written toward the end of her life, it gathers all her experience of prayer and union into one grand vision.</p>
        
        <p>Teresa invites us to imagine the soul as a magnificent crystal castle, filled with light and beauty, at whose center dwells the King — God Himself. The spiritual life, she says, is a journey inward through this castle, passing from one dwelling place to another until we reach the innermost chamber where the soul and God are united in love.</p>
        
        <p>This image captures the essence of Carmelite spirituality: the journey to the center, into silence, into the indwelling presence of the Trinity within us.</p>

        <h2>The seven dwelling places</h2>
        <p>The Interior Castle describes seven "mansions" or dwelling places, each representing a stage in the soul's growth in holiness and intimacy with God.</p>
        
        <h3>The First Mansions – Awakening:</h3>
        <p>The soul becomes aware of its dignity and begins to turn away from sin. It still struggles with distractions and attachments, but grace has stirred the desire for something more.</p>
        
        <h3>The Second Mansions – Commitment:</h3>
        <p>The soul begins to pray more faithfully, though progress feels difficult. The call to conversion deepens, and perseverance becomes essential.</p>
        
        <h3>The Third Mansions – Virtue and Stability:</h3>
        <p>The soul now lives a good, orderly Christian life. Teresa warns, however, that virtue alone is not the end — we must go beyond our own efforts into reliance on God's grace.</p>
        
        <h3>The Fourth Mansions – The Threshold of Contemplation:</h3>
        <p>Here, prayer begins to move from effort to grace. The soul experiences quiet and peace as God begins to draw it into contemplative prayer. This stage marks the crossing from active to infused prayer.</p>
        
        <h3>The Fifth Mansions – Union of the Will:</h3>
        <p>God's action becomes more direct. The soul experiences the "spiritual betrothal" — a deep interior knowing of God's presence and a growing desire to live entirely for Him.</p>
        
        <h3>The Sixth Mansions – Trials and Purification:</h3>
        <p>As the soul approaches full union, it undergoes intense trials, both interior and exterior. These are not punishments but purifications preparing it for perfect love.</p>
        
        <h3>The Seventh Mansions – Spiritual Marriage:</h3>
        <p>The soul now lives in constant awareness of God's indwelling presence. Its will and God's will are one. Teresa describes this union as a peaceful, radiant joy — the fulfillment of all desire.</p>

        <h2>The castle within</h2>
        <p>For St. Teresa, this castle is not a distant symbol but the truth of who we are. Every soul, she says, contains this beauty within — even if sin has obscured its brilliance. Through prayer, repentance, and love, we rediscover the divine image that has always been there.</p>
        
        <p>Teresa reminds us that the door to this castle is prayer. It is through faithful, loving conversation with God that we pass from one room to the next. Each step inward is both a gift of grace and a response of love.</p>
        
        <p>The soul does not travel by speed but by surrender. God Himself draws the soul toward the center, transforming it along the way.</p>

        <h2>A living theology of prayer</h2>
        <p>The Interior Castle gathers all of Teresa's insights into a living theology of prayer. It shows that spiritual progress is not about extraordinary experiences but about growing in humility, love, and detachment.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>In the early mansions, the soul works hard and struggles against distractions.</li>
          <li>In the middle mansions, prayer deepens, and God's action becomes more visible.</li>
          <li>In the final mansions, the soul lives in a quiet intimacy where love itself prays.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The entire journey is marked by the gentle but powerful presence of the Holy Spirit, who purifies, enlightens, and unites the soul to God.</p>

        <h2>The Carmelite path</h2>
        <p>For us in the Carmelite family, The Interior Castle is more than a book — it is a mirror of our vocation. It teaches us to find God not in extraordinary visions but in the depths of our own hearts.</p>
        
        <p>We are called to live from that inner center, where Christ dwells. In daily life — in our work, families, and community — we are invited to return again and again to that sacred interior space, where love becomes life and prayer becomes presence.</p>
        
        <p>Mary, our Mother, perfectly embodies this interiority. She kept all things in her heart, living from that hidden union with God. Following her example, the Carmelite learns to dwell quietly within, where the Lord speaks in silence.</p>

        <h2>A word for our time</h2>
        <p>In a world full of noise, division, and restlessness, St. Teresa's Interior Castle offers a luminous reminder: the journey to God is a journey within. There, in the depths of the soul, we find not emptiness but divine radiance — the God who has never left us.</p>
        
        <p>To read The Interior Castle is to rediscover the beauty and dignity of the human soul and to see prayer not as escape but as transformation.</p>

          "The soul is of such great worth that its beauty and dignity surpass all understanding."
          <footer>— St. Teresa of Avila, The Interior Castle</footer>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>In the silence of prayer, that truth becomes light, and the soul, once purified, shines with the very light of God.</p>
